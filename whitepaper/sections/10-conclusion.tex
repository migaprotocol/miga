MIGA is not about nostalgia. It is about building what tyrants cannot burn.

We trace our lineage to Cyrus, to Darius, to Ferdowsi, to Rumi, to Hafez, to Mossadegh, to the millions who marched and the millions more who fled.

We are not waiting for liberation. We are building the institutions we need---now, in code, beyond their reach.
